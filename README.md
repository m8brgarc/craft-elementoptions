# ElementOptions plugin for Craft CMS

ElementOptions fieldtypes function similar to the native "Checkboxes" or "Radio Buttons" fieldtypes, with the addition of a selected element to each option.
Each element type is supported with it's own fieldtype: Assets, Users, Entries, and Categories.

The most applicable element type is Assets, as it allows you to create a field where users can select from a pre-defined set of Assets.

## Installation
1. Download & unzip the file and place the `elementoptions` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/timkelty/elementoptions.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3.  -OR- install with Composer via `composer require timkelty/craft-elementoptions`
3. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
4. The plugin folder should be named `elementoptions` for Craft to see it.

ElementOptions works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.
